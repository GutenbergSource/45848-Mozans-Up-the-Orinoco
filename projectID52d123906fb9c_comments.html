<HTML><BODY>A travelogue relating of a trip through Venezuela and Colombia slightly over 100 years ago.

<p>No particular difficulties. A bunch of Spanish phrases and verse throughout the work, but not too much; just carefully mind the accents.

<p>Due to the quality of the available scans, the letters h/b, c/e, and n/u have sometimes been mixed up. Wordcheck should catch most of these, but be aware of he/be errors.

<p>The original scans are at <a href="https://archive.org/details/uporinocodownmag00zahm">The Internet Archive</a>, and may be more readable on the pages with plates.

<p>Have fun!
